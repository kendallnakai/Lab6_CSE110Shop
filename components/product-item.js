/* 3. This will likely be the trickiest part. You will be creating the custom component <product-item> for the card. We’ve given you a small start in product-item.js, but make sure to read up on web components using the resources below. Thankfully, as far as the HTML goes we’ve already given you a sample <li> that you can just copy and modify. Make sure to change the img src, img alt, and the inner text of both p elements. Since you will also need the styles for the card since the page styles won’t work in the Shadow DOM, if you look in the styles.css file we’ve marked out the start and end of all the CSS you will need to include.
